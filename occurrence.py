"""
occurrence.py — UTC dose-occurrence helpers (issue #1 PR 1).

Hard rule (issue §0): every comparison and offset runs on aware UTC
datetimes. Local wall time is used only to build occurrence keys and
display strings. Same-timezone arithmetic is wall-clock arithmetic and is
wrong across DST, so builders convert to UTC immediately.

DST rules (issue §3): a nonexistent wall time (02:30 on a spring-forward
day) normalizes forward to the first real instant after it; an ambiguous
wall time (01:30 on a fall-back day) takes the first instance (fold=0).
Python's zoneinfo gives exactly this for fold=0 datetimes.
