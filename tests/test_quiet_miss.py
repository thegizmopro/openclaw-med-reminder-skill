"""
Quiet-hours tests (issue #1 §3.4).

The tick-side quiet rules — reminder exempt, nudge muted except the
first 30 min of quiet hours, missed always logged with the message
muted, overnight summary after quiet end — live in tests/test_tick.py
(AC 26-28). This file keeps the in_quiet_window edit-time check that
doctor (PR 3) and add/edit (PR 4) share; the build_tasks warning tests
are gone with build_tasks itself — doctor FAILs on quiet-hours doses
now (tests/test_doctor.py).
