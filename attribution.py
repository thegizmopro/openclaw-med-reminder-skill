attribution.py — which scheduled dose a confirm credits (issue #1 §4, PR 2).

Nearest-in-time rule: the candidates are the most recent past occurrence
that is unresolved or missed, plus the next future occurrence when the
confirm falls within EARLY_WINDOW of it. The confirm credits the nearer
candidate. When both qualify but the confirm sits between the early
window and the midpoint (possible only when the schedule gap is shorter
than 2× the window), it is genuinely unclear which dose was meant — the
caller must ask (exit 4) instead of guessing.

All comparisons run on aware UTC datetimes (issue §0). Local wall time
is used only through the occurrence helpers (keys and display).
